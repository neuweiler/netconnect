Hmmm, that would be my fault (no notes).  The basic steps to get IP
Masquerading running are:
Build your LAN (loungeroom area network) as described by Mark (web
notes coming Real Soon Now) and get it working.  For this example,
I'll use these IP addresses and parameters:
10.0.0.1 - IP Masq server with the modem & internet connection
10.0.0.2 - client number 1
10.0.0.3 - client number 2
(etc)
255.255.255.0 - netmask for your network
10.0.0.0 - network address
10.0.0.255 - broadcast address
Make sure you can do things like "telnet 10.0.0.1" from the other
machines on the network.
Get PPP dialup working on your IP Masq server.  You should be able to
do things like "ftp ftp.redhat.com" from this box.
Make sure IP Masq support is compiled into your server's kernel (if
you have Red Hat 5.0, skip this step; it's already there).
Type:
  ipfwadm -F -p deny
  ipfwadm -F -a m -S 10.0.0.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0
Set the "default gateway" on the clients to 10.0.0.1 (like Mark
mentioned, the server's default gateway is managed by PPP).
Don't forget to set the nameserver IP address correctly on all
machines.
That should be it.
The main reference that I know of for IP masquerading is the
IP-Masquerade mini-HOWTO.

It's good to hear that it is being used well :).

AFAIK, there has been a Linux port of Quake for a while now.  No idea
where to get it from though, sorry.

I will!
