History of genesis.library
--------------------------

2.0.0 (12.5.98)
---------------

* completely new api.
* first release that works with users defined in amitcp:db/passwd.
* added window for user authentication.

2.0.1 (15.5.98)
---------------

* added popup list for usernames
* now only users get loaded into userlist that aren't disabled.

2.0.2 (03.6.98)
---------------

* added functions ReadFile() and WriteFile() since they're used
  internally anyway
* corrected nasty bug: when setting global user the usergroup.lib
  was opened but the lib base pointer wasn't set => for amitcp
  stuff the user was always 'nobody'.
* enabled compiler optimizer => smaller code

2.0.3 (05.6.98)
---------------

* added an argument to GetUser(): title, which allows you to place
  some text into the requester. Please refer to the doc or test.c
* removed argument "app" from GetUser() since not enogh registers
  were available. this value can be extracted from the given
  window object anyway.
* modified GetGlobalUser() api. no arguments are required anymore.
  will return user if globaluser is set or NULL => no longer opens
  user requester automatically. this allows to check if globaluser
  is set without opening a req. You can use GetUser() and
  SetGlobalUser() instead.

2.0.4 (07.06.98)
----------------

* now GetUser() opens muimaster.library itself and creates its own
  mui application to create the login requester. This solves the
  problem with crashes (hopefully) and also allows non-mui
  applications to use the login requester.
* as a result the number of arguments passed to GetUser shrinked
  and "username" and "title" are passed in different registers.
  => correct your application's code (remove MUIMasterBase pointer
  and the pointer to your mui window and recompile).
* added new argument to GetUser() : flags. Please refer to
  libraries/genesis.h for possible values.

2.0.5 (15.06.98)
----------------

* changed arguments of GetUser() once more (SORRY !!)
  Now looks like this: GetUser(name, password, title, flags);
  password = passwd of the user if known.

2.0.6 (01.07.98)
----------------

* corrected bug: when getuser() was called with a given name and
  the user changed the username, the passwd for the user getuser()
  was called with was asked for.
* added IsOnline() to check if at least one iface is online.

2.0.7 (08.07.98)
----------------

* now opens user requester on frontmost screen.
* finally the version string gets printed correctly now.

3.0.0 (22.09.98)
----------------

* extended user data: flags, max_time, timeserver, restricted_time

3.0.1 (28.09.98)
----------------

* extended IsOnline() functionality : added commands IOC_AskUser and
  IOC_Force . now you can not only check if an iface is online but you
  can also make the lib ask the user if he wants to go online or you
  can force a connection to be established.
  if no bsdsocket.lib can be found, AmiTCP:Genesis is launched
  automatically.
* now also supports miami (eeeekk ! :( ) . e.g. it checks if it's
  online or not. But if it's not running, the lib will try to launch
  Genesis only => miami must be running to be supported. (why ? just
  look at the name of the lib !)

3.0.2 (01.10.98)
----------------

* removed minor bug in ParseNext() which caused that encrypted passwords
  with a '"' got cut too early. (had effect on genesis(prefs) passwd
  parsing).


3.0.3 (03.10.98)
----------------

* solved problem that userlist didn't get loaded in some cases.
* reduced stack usage to prevent crashes from stack overflow.
