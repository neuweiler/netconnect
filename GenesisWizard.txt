History for GenesisWizard
=========================

2.0.2 (19.4.98)
---------------

* pages are now built at startup and no longer dynamically.
  this improoves speed and eliminates problems when switching
  pages but eats much more memory.
* removed modem-detect since it caused more trouble than it
  helped (e.g. isdn) and only 7 modem types were supported.
* added page #2 to choose between modem/direct connection.


2.0.3 (27.4.98)
---------------

* readded all those fancy wiz-pics again.. minor growth of
  filesize :)
* removed "isp info" pages. if the ip, gateway / destination
  or DNS addresses are unknown before iface is put online
  then requesters will appear (in the future).
* added a page to enter sanaII configuration details (config
  file and interface parameters).

2.1.0 (30.4.98)
---------------

* ready for beta testing again.. (especially sanaII section)
* now requesters will popup when one of those is missing:
  ip addr, gateway addr, dns addr, hostname, domainname
* env:apppdns1 was not deleted (misspelled filename in DeleteFile())
  and thus they were probably reused after switching the provider config.

2.1.1 (4.5.98)
--------------

* If gateway or dns were given manually, they will be shown properly now
  in the display-config-window.
* temporarely added debug information.. to locate the point where ominous
  crashes occur (no enforcer hits, only one big bang).
